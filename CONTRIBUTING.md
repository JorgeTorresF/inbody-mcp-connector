# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Process
1. Open an issue describing the change (bug/feature/docs).
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
3. Use **Conventional Commits** (e.g., `feat: add webhook guidance`).
4. Run `make lint` locally.
5. Open a Pull Request and link the issue.

## Guidelines
- Keep docs concise and actionable.
- Prefer English identifiers in specs (`weight`, `skeletal_muscle_mass`, `body_fat_percentage`).
- Do not commit secrets. Use environment variables or GitHub Secrets.
- Update `/docs` for any user-facing change.
