2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
3. Commit changes with clear messages.

## Development guidelines
- Keep docs concise and actionable.
- Prefer English identifiers in specs (`weight`, `skeletal_muscle_mass`, `body_fat_percentage`).

- Follow the style enforced by `.editorconfig`.

## Docs
- Update relevant docs under `/docs` for any user-facing change.
